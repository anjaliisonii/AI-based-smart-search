# AI-based-smart-search
 I developed an end-to-end web app for the Smart Search Tool of Analytics Vidya. The project has been deployed on the Hugging Face platform using Streamlit.  The core of the search functionality is built using a Large Language Model (LLM), specifically the paraphrase-MiniLM-L6-v2 model from the sentence-transformers library. Additionally, I scraped the course data using BeautifulSoup to power the search engine with real-time data.
